# Presentations & Reports
It's the respository of my presentations and reports that are not submitted or published

1. Oral Presentation
Title: Detection of Magnetic Signal of Superconducting Transition in 2D Material 
Name of the conference: Regular Conference in the Physics Department of Fudan University
Time: August 2021
Details: I worked on device design under the guidance of Prof. Yuanbo Zhang at Fudan University during the summer of 2021. This project focused on developing a sample stage to detect magnetic signals due to the superconducting transition. The idea was based on the mirror method showing the distribution of the magnetic signal due to the superconducting transition. The mirror method makes detection simple by measuring the reflected magnetic field, while traditional direction detection typically involves numerous electronic devices and complex electronics designs. What’s more, my programming skills were of great help with the simulation of the magnetic field, which improved the accuracy of the design. I shared my design model with my colleagues at the regular conference at Fudan University, and my oral presentation was appreciated, especially by my supervisor, Prof. Yuanbo Zhang.
